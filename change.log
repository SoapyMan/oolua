1.2.2
*Converted premake scripts to premake4 
*optimised checking of a type against a requested type via casting and storing a function taking the parameters to 
lua_Cfunction which requires less usage of the Lua stack. 
*moved Luna licence to a more suitable section of code
*removed dead code from oolua_storage.h
*removed dead code from class_from_stack.h
*added setting a user data's none const name whilst changing it's constant status in set_type_top_to_none_const to 
prevent potentail errors. As the name and none constant name use a pointer compare when checking for constant status.
*added xcode support, tests required linking gtest and gmock normally i.e. -lgmock instead of gmock specified way gmock config - *
*added xcode test unit bash build script.
*build logs directed to there own directory
*added new test project "tests_may_fail" for issue 7 (http://code.google.com/p/oolua/issues/detail?id=7)
this fails soft on an error i.e. returns 0 from main not 1. moved effected 
tests (pushing and pulling signed int and signed long)to the new test project.
*changed bash build scripts to run the tests_may_fail swell as unit.tests
*added comment in lua_includes.h for mingw users
*added a readme with details of library as many download locations are now available
* fixed passing a c style string to a member function bug as reported by airbash http://code.google.com/p/oolua/issues/detail?id=8

* fixed typo in xcode_premake4.sh
* adjusted premake recursive file inclusion to offset premake4.2 problem
* renamed gnu build script to gnu_tests.sh to reflect what it is doing
* added gnu_build.sh for building a local install
* added xcode_build.sh for building a local install
* added codeblocks_build.sh for building a local install
* renamed codeblocks_premake4.sh to codeblocks_tests.sh to reflect what it is doing
* added dl to link flags for unit tests in linux builds
* added vs2008x86_build.bat for building a local install
