1.3.0
Initial support for constructors
http://code.google.com/p/oolua/issues/detail?id=9 Exporting classes with no public destructor
Added a file generator to the generator solution for constructor parameters
Added the types No_default_constructor,No_public_constructors and No_public_destructor to oolua_typedefs.h
Removed oolua_construct which had the default constructor for earlier versions
Added OOLUA_ONLY_DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTOR
Broke ABI removing default constructor being forced
Updated tests which used old style constructors
added OOLUA::table_set_value which does not retrieve the table from the registry yet uses a stack index
added convenance function OOLUA::new_table 
added copy constructor to Lua_ref and Lua_table
removed static keyword from member function generator for parameter types.
added param traits for Lua_ref 
added push member to lua_ref
enabled a constructor to take a Lua_func_ref
* fixed user type return on the stack http://code.google.com/p/oolua/issues/detail?id=10 reported by Tomm on the mailing list
moved Lua_table in parameter trait to parma_traits.h
enabled a constructor to take a Lua_table
added method to pull a table reference from the stack
enabled a constructor to take a Lua_table_ref
added a conversion constructor to Lua_table from Lua_ref_table, introduced a friend hack!!
Moved the Lua_table member function get_table to the private interface
Refactored the pulling of a registry type (Lua_ref<T> and Lua_table)
pulling a registry type when nil is on the stack, frees the registry ref and sets it to invalid
Refactored Lua_table removing the lua_State instead using the reference's state member
added a default implementation of Proxy_class which creates a typedef that identifies it as a none proxy type
Public members retrieved with get_?, now push by reference if the type has a proxy type and it is by value

1.2.2
*Converted premake scripts to premake4 
*optimised checking of a type against a requested type via casting and storing a function taking the parameters to 
lua_Cfunction which requires less usage of the Lua stack. 
*moved Luna licence to a more suitable section of code
*removed dead code from oolua_storage.h
*removed dead code from class_from_stack.h
*added setting a user data's none const name whilst changing it's constant status in set_type_top_to_none_const to 
prevent potentail errors. As the name and none constant name use a pointer compare when checking for constant status.
*added xcode support, tests required linking gtest and gmock normally i.e. -lgmock instead of gmock specified way gmock config - *
*added xcode test unit bash build script.
*build logs directed to there own directory
*added new test project "tests_may_fail" for issue 7 (http://code.google.com/p/oolua/issues/detail?id=7)
this fails soft on an error i.e. returns 0 from main not 1. moved effected 
tests (pushing and pulling signed int and signed long)to the new test project.
*changed bash build scripts to run the tests_may_fail swell as unit.tests
*added comment in lua_includes.h for mingw users
*added a readme with details of library as many download locations are now available
* fixed passing a c style string to a member function bug as reported by airbash http://code.google.com/p/oolua/issues/detail?id=8
* fixed a corresponding bug of a member function which returns a c style string.
* added define in lua_includes.h to support Lua 5.2 and 5.1.4 simultaneously 
* fixed typo in xcode_premake4.sh
* adjusted premake recursive file inclusion to offset premake4.2 problem
* renamed gnu build script to gnu_tests.sh to reflect what it is doing
* added gnu_build.sh for building a local install
* added xcode_build.sh for building a local install
* added codeblocks_build.sh for building a local install
* renamed codeblocks_premake4.sh to codeblocks_tests.sh to reflect what it is doing
* added dl to link flags for unit tests in linux builds
* added vs2008x86_build.bat for building a local install
* renamed vs2008x86_premake4.bat to vs2008x86_tests.bat to reflect what it is doing
* added codeblocks_build.bat for building a local install
* renamed codeblocks_premake4.bat to codeblocks_tests.bat to reflect what it is doing

1.2.1
* was actually 1.2.0 yet due to a packaging error had to be incremented.
1.2.0
added fields to Lua_ud which are used for comparison removing the metatable raw_equals.
added name_size to proxy classes and updated the generation file to reflect changes.
changed headers that used old licence.
added a fuction to register a type and all it's bases.
added a couple of profile tests in the directory profile.
1.1.0
Removed the dynamic allocation of Proxy classes to use stack versions.
